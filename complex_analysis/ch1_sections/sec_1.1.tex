\section{Complex Numbers}

\begin{defn}[\textbf{Complex Numbers}]
	A set of objects that can be added and multiplied together and produce another element of the set under the following conditions:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Every real number is a complex number, and if $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$, then their sum and product as complex numbers are the same as their sum and products as real numbers.
		\item There is a complex number denoted $i$ such that $i^2 = -1$.
		\item $\forall z \in \mathbb{C}$ with $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ can be written uniquely as: \[z = a + bi\]
		\item The ordinary laws of arithmetic for addition and multiplication are satisfied $\forall z \in \mathbb{C}$:
		\subitem distributive law holds
		\subitem associative law holds
		\subitem commutative law holds
		\subitem if $1 \in \mathbb{R}$ then $1z = z$
		\subitem if $0 \in \mathbb{R}$ then $0z = 0$
		\subitem $z + (-1)z = 0$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[\textbf{Conjugate}]
	$\bar{z} \in \mathbb{C}$ such that: 
	\[ z = a + bi\] \[\text{iff}\] \[\bar{z} = a - bi \]
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[\textbf{Inverse}]
	$z^{-1} \in \mathbb{C}$ such that \[z\cdot z^{-1} = 1\]
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[\textbf{Absolute Value} $|z|$ of $z$]
	\[|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\]
\end{defn}
\begin{thm}
	$|z|$ satisfies the following properties. If $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$, then:
	\[|\alpha\beta| = |\alpha||\beta|\]
	\[|\alpha + \beta| \;\leq\; |\alpha| + |\beta| \;\;\text{(triangle inequality)}\]
\end{thm}
