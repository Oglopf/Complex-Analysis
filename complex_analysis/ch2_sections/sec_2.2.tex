\section{Convergent Power Series}
Let ${ \{ z_n \} }$ be a \emph{sequence of complex numbers}.

Consider the series:
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} z_n
\end{align*}

\begin{defn}[\textbf{Partial Sum of a Sequence of Complex Numbers}]
  \begin{align*}
    s_n = \sum_{k = 1}^{n} z_k = z_1 + z_2 + \cdots z_n
  \end{align*}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[\textbf{Convergent Series}]
  The series $s_n$ converges if there is some $w \in \mathbb{C}$ such that the following limit exists:
  \begin{align*}
    \lim_{n \to \infty}s_n = w
  \end{align*}
\end{defn}

In which case we say that $w$ is equal to the \emph{sum of the series.}

Formally:

\begin{defn}[\textbf{Sum of the Series}]
  \begin{align*}
    w = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} z_n
  \end{align*}
\end{defn}

Now consider series of functions and deal with questions of \emph{uniformity.}

Suppose that $S$ is a set and $f$ a bounded function on $S$.

\begin{defn}[\textbf{Sup norm}]
  Let sup be the least upper bound, then:
  \begin{align*}
    \| f \|_S = \| f \| = \sup_{z \in S} | f(z) | \\
  \end{align*}
\end{defn}

Now, let $\{ f_n \}$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$ be a \emph{sequence of functions} on $S$.

\begin{defn}[\textbf{Uniform Convergence}]
  The sequence $ \{ f_n \}$ converges uniformly on $S$ if there exists a 
  function $f$ on $S$ satisfying the following properties.

  Given $\epsilon$, there exists $N$ such that if $n \geq N$ then:

  \begin{align*}
    \| f_n - f \| < \epsilon \\
  \end{align*}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[\textbf{Cauchy Sequence}]
  We call $\{f_n\}$ Cauchy if given $\epsilon$ there exists $N$ such that if $m, n \geq N$ then:
  \begin{align*}
    \| f_n - f_m \| < \epsilon
  \end{align*}
\end{defn}

It is important to note that if a sequence $\{f_n\}$ of functions is Cauchy, then it converges 
uniformly. You should be able to prove this to yourself (think about what you get if you're cauchy, hint: it 
is small!)

Now, keeping in mind we are working with sequences of functions at this point, we define:

\begin{defn}[\textbf{Partial Sum of a Sequence of Complex Functions}]
  \begin{align*}
    s_n = \sum_{k = 1}^{n} f_k = f_1 + f_2 + \cdots f_n
  \end{align*}
\end{defn}

This above series converges \emph{uniformly} if the sequence of partial sums $\{s_n\}$ converges uniformly.
