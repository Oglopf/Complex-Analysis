\section{Relations Between Formal and Convergent Series}

\subsubsection*{Sums and Products}
Let $f = f(T)$ and $g = g(t)$ be formal power series.

If $f$ converges absolutely for some complex number $z$, then we have the value $f(z)$ and similarly for $g(z).$

And so the big theorem here is that if $f$ and $g$ converge on the disc, then so do their sum and products.
