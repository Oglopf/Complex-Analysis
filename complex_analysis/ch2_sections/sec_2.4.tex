\section{Analytic Functions}

Let $f$ be a function defined in some neighborhood of a point $z_0$.

\begin{defn}[\bfseries Analytic function]
    $f$ is analytic at $z_0$ if there is a power series of the form:
    \begin{align*}
        \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} a_n (z - z_0)^n \\
    \end{align*}
    and some $r > 0$ such that the series converges absolutely for $|z - z_0| < r.$

    And, for $z$ that satisfy the above one has:
    \begin{align*}
        f(z) & = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} a_n (z - z_0)^n \\
    \end{align*}
\end{defn}

One says that $f$ is analytic on $U$ if $f$ is analytic at every point of $U.$

One could also say $f$ \bfseries has a power series expansion at $z_0.$

Use these identities:
$f$ is holomorphic:
$\int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = 0$

$\int_{\gamma} \frac{1}{z} dz = 2\pi i $

But notice:
$\int_{\gamma} \frac{1}{z^2} dz = 0 $

$\varphi \mapsto f \circ \varphi \circ f^{-1}$
