\subsection{Proofs}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prove in detail that if $u, v$ satisfy the Cauch-Riemann equations, then the function
	\begin{align*}
		f(z) = f(x + iy) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \\
	\end{align*}
	is holomorphic.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
	Let $u,v$ satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The aim is to show that since the equations satisfy cauchy-riemann,
	then they \emph{must} be everywhere differentiable and therefore holomorphic, or else they could not satisfy the equation.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Incomplete Proofs}
Only proof is incomplete, but you just need to work backwards from the proof in the section to arrive at the result.
